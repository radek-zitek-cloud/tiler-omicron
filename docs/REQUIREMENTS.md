# Dashboard Tiling System - Requirements Document

## Project Overview

### Purpose

Develop a web-based information dashboard featuring a flexible tile-based layout system. The primary focus is on creating a robust, user-friendly grid arrangement system that allows users to create, manage, and organize dashboard tiles with intuitive drag-and-drop functionality.

### Scope

This initial phase focuses exclusively on the tiling system infrastructure, including tile creation, deletion, resizing, and rearrangement. Content management for individual tiles will be addressed in future phases.

### Target Users

- Dashboard administrators
- Data analysts
- Business users requiring customizable information displays

## Functional Requirements

### Core Tile Operations

#### FR-1: Tile Creation

- **FR-1.1** Users must be able to create new tiles through a "Add Tile" button or interface element
- **FR-1.2** New tiles should appear with default dimensions (e.g., 2x2 grid units)
- **FR-1.3** New tiles should be automatically positioned in the first available space
- **FR-1.4** Each tile must have a unique identifier for tracking and manipulation
- **FR-1.5** Tiles should have a placeholder content/title indicating their purpose

#### FR-2: Tile Deletion

- **FR-2.1** Users must be able to delete tiles through a delete button/icon on each tile
- **FR-2.2** Deletion should require confirmation to prevent accidental removal
- **FR-2.3** When a tile is deleted, the layout should automatically reorganize to fill gaps
- **FR-2.4** Deleted tile space should be reclaimed by other tiles or collapsed

#### FR-3: Tile Resizing

- **FR-3.1** Users must be able to resize tiles by dragging corner/edge handles
- **FR-3.2** Minimum tile size must be enforced (e.g., 1x1 grid unit)
- **FR-3.3** Maximum tile size should be configurable (default: full grid width/height)
- **FR-3.4** Resizing should provide visual feedback during the operation
- **FR-3.5** Adjacent tiles should automatically adjust their positions when a tile is resized
- **FR-3.6** Resize handles should be clearly visible and accessible

#### FR-4: Tile Rearrangement

- **FR-4.1** Users must be able to drag and drop tiles to new positions
- **FR-4.2** During drag operations, other tiles should temporarily adjust to show available drop zones
- **FR-4.3** Drop zones should be visually highlighted during drag operations
- **FR-4.4** The system should prevent overlapping tiles
- **FR-4.5** Tiles should snap to grid positions during placement
- **FR-4.6** The layout should automatically reflow when tiles are moved

### Grid System Requirements

#### FR-5: Grid Layout Engine

- **FR-5.1** The grid system must be based on flexible CSS layout principles (Flexbox/CSS Grid)
- **FR-5.2** Grid should support responsive breakpoints for different screen sizes
- **FR-5.3** Grid units should be configurable (default: 12-column system)
- **FR-5.4** Tiles should occupy whole grid units only (no fractional positioning)
- **FR-5.5** The grid should automatically expand vertically as needed
- **FR-5.6** Horizontal scrolling should be avoided; vertical scrolling is acceptable

#### FR-6: Layout Persistence

- **FR-6.1** Tile arrangements must persist across browser sessions
- **FR-6.2** Layout state should be saved automatically after each modification
- **FR-6.3** The system should restore the exact tile positions and sizes on page reload
- **FR-6.4** Layout data should be stored in browser localStorage or similar persistent storage

### User Interface Requirements

#### FR-7: Visual Design

- **FR-7.1** Tiles must have clear visual boundaries (borders, shadows, or background colors)
- **FR-7.2** Active/selected tiles should have distinct visual states
- **FR-7.3** Drag handles and resize controls should be clearly visible and accessible
- **FR-7.4** The interface should provide visual feedback during all drag/resize operations
- **FR-7.5** Empty grid areas should be visually distinguishable from occupied areas

#### FR-8: Interaction Feedback

- **FR-8.1** Hover states should be implemented for all interactive elements
- **FR-8.2** Loading states should be shown during tile operations
- **FR-8.3** Success/error messages should be displayed for tile operations
- **FR-8.4** Smooth animations should accompany tile movements and resizing

## Technical Requirements

### TR-1: Technology Stack

- **TR-1.1** Frontend framework: Vue.js
- **TR-1.2** CSS Framework: Bootstrap
- **TR-1.3** Build tool: Vite
- **TR-1.4** Browser support: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+

### TR-2: Performance Requirements

- **TR-2.1** Tile operations should respond within 100ms
- **TR-2.2** Layout calculations should not block the UI thread
- **TR-2.3** The application should support up to 50 tiles without performance degradation
- **TR-2.4** Memory usage should remain stable during extended use

### TR-3: Responsive Design

- **TR-3.1** The dashboard must work on desktop screens (1024px+ width)
- **TR-3.2** Tablet support (768px - 1023px) with adapted grid system
- **TR-3.3** Mobile support (320px - 767px) with stacked or simplified layout
- **TR-3.4** Touch devices should support touch-based drag and drop operations

### TR-4: Code Architecture

- **TR-4.1** Component-based architecture with reusable tile components
- **TR-4.2** Separation of concerns between layout engine and tile content
- **TR-4.3** State management solution for tracking tile positions and properties
- **TR-4.4** Event-driven architecture for tile operations
- **TR-4.5** Modular CSS/styling approach for easy theming

## Implementation Specifications

### Data Models

#### Tile Model

```typescript
interface Tile {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  x: number; // Grid column position
  y: number; // Grid row position
  width: number; // Width in grid units
  height: number; // Height in grid units
  minWidth?: number; // Minimum width constraint
  minHeight?: number; // Minimum height constraint
